A diplomatic incident arose between the governments of Mexico and El Salvador, concerning 12 Salvadorean citizens wearing face masks on a plane departing from Mexico City to San Salvador. Nayib Bukele, president of El Salvador denounced as "irresponsible" that they were allowed to board the plane along with other passengers and offered to send a plane to transport them without contact with other people. The claim was supported by Avianca airline while the Mexican government said that there were no reasons to assume that they were positive for COVID-19. Eventually, the flight was cancelled. Marcelo Ebrard, head of Foreign Affairs announced after negative results of COVID tests of that Salvadorean passengers.

March 23 to 31

People entering a special respiratory illness symptom assessment area at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán, Mexico City. The hospital was converted into a special care area for COVID patients.
Mexico entered Phase 2 of the coronavirus pandemic on March 23, according to the World Health Organization, with 367 confirmed cases. Phase 2 includes cases where the sick individuals did not have direct contact with someone who had recently been in another country. On the same day it was confirmed that two more people died from COVID-19, raising the total to 4 reported deaths.[83] That day was announced on President López Obrador's daily press conference the realization of the National Campaign of Healthy Distancing (Jornada Nacional de Sana Distancia [es]) a national program of non-pharmaceutical measures based on social distancing among the behavioral changes suggested by WHO as hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected. On that same day in the daily press conference was announced also a media campaign led by "Susana Distancia" (wordplay of a healthy distance) a fictional female superhero aiming to promote social distancing into the people.

Meanwhile, a Mitofsky poll showed that 63% of Mexicans feared contracting Covid-19 and 25.5% feared dying from it. 28% said they were not willing to stay in their homes. 38.6% believed President López Obrador was handling the situation well, and 37% disapproved. Access to supermarkets in Coahuila was limited to one person per family, and the temperature of that person was taken before entering. The same rule applies to drugstores and convenience stores in the state, which has 12 confirmed cases of Covid-19.

At his morning news conference on March 24, President López Obrador announced that Mexico entered Phase 2 of the coronavirus pandemic, in effect until April 30.

On the same day 405 total cases of COVID-19 were confirmed.

On March 25, Dr. Abelardo Ávila, researcher at the Salvador Zubirán National Institute of Health Sciences and Nutrition warned that Mexico was particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic because of underlying chronic illnesses such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension.

On March 26, President López Obrador revealed he asked the G20 to ensure that wealthy countries cannot take control of the world's medical supplies. He also called for assurances that borders would not be closed to commerce and that tariffs would not be unilaterally increased. Lastly, he called for an end to racism and discrimination.

On March 27 the federal government bought 5,000 ventilators from China as the government prepares for Phase 3 of the pandemic.[107] The total confirmed cases rose to 717; twelve deaths were reported, and there were 2,475 suspected cases.PROFECO (Office of the Federal Prosecutor for the Consumer) said it will fine merchants who unfairly raise the prices on household goods.

Nurses in Jalisco have been forced to get off public transportation and physically attacked by people fearful of COVID-19. Medical workers there and elsewhere have been advised not to wear their uniforms outside the hospital. The same day the total confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 1215 and one more death was reported. The government of Mexico City announced that 90% of the businesses in Mexico City would have to close because of the national health emergency declaration of the day before. In Austin, Texas, Public Health officials started investigating an apparent cluster of COVID-19 after 28 of 70 “spring breakers” (students at the University of Texas at Austin) tested positive following their trip to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, in early March. The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in Monclova, Coahuila, reported that 29 medical and nursing staff tested positive for COVID-19. No patients have been infected.

## March 29

### The main problems we detected are: 

- Information is spread accross several platforms, most of it is useless.
- People still don't know the basic information regarding taking care of themselves, protective equipment etc...
- The population is not asking or doesn't understand demographic information, they are much more concerned about a possible cure or how to treat the illness.
- Most of the people polled are concerned about information manipulation by the government and institutions, they think they lie.
- Regarding the use of facemasks most people have no idea in how to use them.
- Basic reagents such as alcohol and protective equipment such as facemasks are out of stock, and other type of useless reagents such as isopropylic alcohol are being sold at high prices.
- Several patients are automedicating with Cloroquin, even overdosing and there are some patients in trouble because of this automedication.

### After brainstorming our tentative solution is:

- A graphical-first information Aggregator that people will WANT to consult almost on a daily basis, that will include all the recommeendations from the institutions worldwide and the mexican government.

- A chatbot with these recommendations 

- IoT devices to monitor risky patients (focusing on high blood pressure and diabetes)

- An open source Ventilator to keep ahead of the curve.


### For the next week we will work on developing an information aggregator, a tenative chatbot and we will keep working on a form to poll people about possible solutions.

- It will include a better map UI, NOT only with cases and deaths, but better valuable information. 
- We will see a map with hospitals and the designaed hospitals that are treatting COVID19 as per the information of the Mexican government: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrcjcdwy_xY

- Perhaps this is the most important message from the Health Secretary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pORVh2QAYTU

- With these we will aim to help the public in locating which hospital can receive you in case that you develop symptoms.
- Three tabs including information

At this moment we are a 848 and 16 deaths, so taking into consideration the development in other similar countries such as Spain, we are in the best moment to start acting in terms of increasing PPE manufacturing, sharing of information and other measures.

## April 4th

We will completely drop the ventilator solution as several institutions, startups and makers are already covering that part. There has been an incredible influx of those solutions in Mexico and for us to be doing the same will not add much to that part of the solution, so we will focus on developing the web platform and the IoT components and the Chatbot.

Also, and perhaps this is the most important new development on our side: we will focus our IoT development not on the patients, as it will not have the desired impact, but on the Medical professionals. I.e. doctors, nurses and paramedics. They are the ones that need the most help right now and having some impact in their life quality during this contingency will have great impact.

Adding to the problems, one that came into our attention was the incredible amount of "fake news", sensasionalistic "news" and fake information that exists about the contingency. With that we will then "cure" the proper information into a feed on the platform and add a section indicating all that fake information so the user may be able to discern into them. 

That said we will start creating a prescence in social networks focusing firstly on Reddit and Twitter. And we created a google form that we will begin spreading to know about the level of information the average Mexican has.

First approach:

After some UI redesign:

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/J24rJGG/Capturse.jpg">

We are still working on it and the news feed and aggregator-discriminator.

This is the link to our google form that we will be using to gather info on the informative state of the population, it is simple but better than nothing to prove certain hypothesis that we havce:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYP7ZD9Yssr_M3wZXP7m_UkMtmt5a4nNVtIxiEPwswNu8Qsw/viewform

At this moment we are at 1890 cases and 79 deaths, we will strive to launch the application and begin developing the IoT devices of the solution next week.

## April 17th 

We decided the scope and the additional service that we will provide;
To focus on a regional solution as we can have a bigger impact like this. 
And we will attack perhaps the two problems that are the most neglected. 
The first one is fake information and the emotional state of people
And the second is neglecting the health and long working hours that expose doctors and frontliners to become the most representative group regarding the virus. And noone is developing anything for their well being
 
Our Solution is a COVID19 information aggregator and data platform for Mexico, that includes IoT risk assessing devices for medical professionals.
 
Lets go though the aggregator first:
It is an IBM cloud foundry application that makes use of several of IBM’s cloud toolchains and other services, and we do ML, but we’ll get to that. The intention of this aggregator is to become a source in which you can be informed of everything regarding COVID19 for the day in less than 5 minutes and in a very simple way.
 
First we have the map by state that shows the number of cases in an easy manner and a graph that shows the growth of that.

Then we have the most important actions that a person has to take in order to prevent the spread and instructions on how to do so, such as how to properly wash hands, symptoms of the disease, social distancing and what to do if you think that you have the disease.
 
And next is where the Machine learning enters and what is most neglected right now, the Emotional Positivity Map 
by state that shows the mental state of each one of the provinces.  This was done by a Machine learning algorithm that browses through twitter, selects those tweets from the province in question and assigns a positivity measure via the Tone Analyzer service, of course we first translated the tweet via another service before. Along the days we have proved that this service work as the state coincides with important news that happened in each province 
Lastly we have a service that separates the real news from the fake news and by just reading the tweets published we can get up to date on the issues.
 
The iot part of Our solution tracks, analyses and gives recommendations to Medical professionals in the front lines via a web app developed with IBM ioT and node red.It includes a wearable band that we integrated with a set of sensors that can be embedded easily into clothing. Whenever the doctor or frontliner has performed a big number of steps or the telemetry shows that that he has over stretched via temperature, movement or other it will send an alarm, notification and recommendations to stop and take some rest.
These kinds of measures have shown to decrease considerably the risk of these professionals.
 
Whenever we have several of these devices we will be able to perform better analytics and even ML models, which we will incorporate into the main platform and the Emotions and Positivity map. This solution has the potential of incorporating the whole gambit of information about the current pandemic and will help us prepare for the future one. This of course employing IBM’s cloud technology, IoT and Machine Learning like it was never done before. And it might help as a model for developing countries to fight pandemics.

By now there are 6875 Cases of COVID19 in Mexico, we will rush development and launch this week.
