### State of SARS-COV-2, COVID19 in Mexico:




## March 29

### The main problems we detected are: 

- Information is spread accross several platforms, most of it is useless.
- People still don't know the basic information regarding taking care of themselves, protective equipment etc...
- The population is not asking or doesn't understand demographic information, they are much more concerned about a possible cure or how to treat the illness.
- Most of the people polled are concerned about information manipulation by the government and institutions, they think they lie.
- Regarding the use of facemasks most people have no idea in how to use them.
- Basic reagents such as alcohol and protective equipment such as facemasks are out of stock, and other type of useless reagents such as isopropylic alcohol are being sold at high prices.
- Several patients are automedicating with Cloroquin, even overdosing and there are some patients in trouble because of this automedication.

### After brainstorming our tentative solution is:

- A graphical-first information Aggregator that people will WANT to consult almost on a daily basis, that will include all the recommeendations from the institutions worldwide and the mexican government.

- A chatbot with these recommendations 

- IoT devices to monitor risky patients (focusing on high blood pressure and diabetes)

- An open source Ventilator to keep ahead of the curve.


### For the next week we will work on developing an information aggregator, a tenative chatbot and we will keep working on a form to poll people about possible solutions.

- It will include a better map UI, NOT only with cases and deaths, but better valuable information. 
- We will see a map with hospitals and the designaed hospitals that are treatting COVID19 as per the information of the Mexican government: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrcjcdwy_xY

- Perhaps this is the most important message from the Health Secretary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pORVh2QAYTU

- With these we will aim to help the public in locating which hospital can receive you in case that you develop symptoms.
- Three tabs including information

At this moment we are a 848 and 16 deaths, so taking into consideration the development in other similar countries such as Spain, we are in the best moment to start acting in terms of increasing PPE manufacturing, sharing of information and other measures.

Adding to the problems, one that came into our attention was the incredible amount of "fake news", sensasionalistic "news" and fake information that exists about the contingency. We will then include a 

With that we will then "cure" the proper information into a feed on the platform and add a section indicating all that fake information so the user may be able to discern into them. 

That said we will start creating a prescence in social networks focusing firstly on Reddit and Twitter.
