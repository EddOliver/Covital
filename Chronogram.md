The main problems we detected are: 

- Information is spread accross several platforms, most of it is useless.
- People still don't know the basic information regarding taking care of themselves, protective equipment etc...
- The population is not asking or doesn't understand demographic information, they are much more concerned about a possible cure or how to treat the illness.
- Most of the people polled are concerned about information manipulation by the government and institutions, they think they lie.
- Regarding the use of facemasks most people have no idea in how to use them.
- Basic reagents such as alcohol and protective equipment such as facemasks are out of stock, and other type of useless reagents such as isopropylic alcohol are being sold at high prices.
- Several patients are automedicating with Cloroquin, even overdosing and there are some patients in trouble because of this automedication.

After brainstorming our tentative solution is:

- A graphical-first information Aggregator that people will WANT to consult almost on a daily basis, that will include all the recommeendations from the institutions worldwide and the mexican government.

- A chatbot with tttheese recommendations 

- IoT devices to monitor risk in patients 

- An open source ventilator to keep ahead of the curve






For the next week we will work on developing an information aggregator, a tenative chatbot and wee will keep working on a form to poll people about possible solutions.

At this moment we are a 848 and 16 deahs so taking into consideeraion the deveelopment in other similar countries such as spain, we are in the best momentt to start acting.
