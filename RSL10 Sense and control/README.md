## The Hardware

Whether it is monitoring the safety of workers on job sites or wanting the lamp to turn on when it gets dark enough in the living room, the RSL10-SENSE-DB-GEVK can be used in multitudes of designs to create solutions to everyday problems and obstacles. Using the industry's lowest power Bluetooth® Low Energy SoC, the RSL10, and 7 configurable sensors the RSL10 Sensor Development Kit can easily help you develop your Internet of Things applications. The compact design and 1 year deep sleep battery life from the CR2032 coin cell battery will enable designs of all sizes and all areas of IoT.

Included in the RSL10-SENSE-DB-GEVK box is:

RSL10-SENSE-DB-GEVB
Segger J-Link LITE Cortex-M debugger
USB to Mini USB cord

Based on the RSL10 System-in-Package (SiP)

Industry's lowest power consumption in Deep Sleep Mode (62.5 nW) and Rx in Receive Mode (7 mW)
Configurable, low-power sensors

*NOA1305 (Ambient light)
*BHI160 (Integrated low power smart hub, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope)
*BMM150 (Low Power, Low Noise 3-axis digital geomagnetic sensor)
*BME680 (Integrated high-accuracy gas, pressure, humidity and temperature sensor)
*INMP522 (Ultra-low noise digital Microphone)
*APTF1616 (Programmable RGB LED)
*N24RF64 (64kB NFC EEPROM)
*3 programmable push-buttons

## The Software
Supported by the RSL10 Sense and Control app (IoS ®, Android ™) for cloud connectivity. Using this app you can select multiple sensors to monitor an send to a connected cloud service. You can also add your own sensors and actuators to be controlled through the app using the plus button on the bottom right of the sensor selector screen.

There are 2 modes to the RSL10 Sense and Control app, Send and Receive mode. Receive Mode is for viewing the data from the sensors controlling any actuators you have connected through BLE or the cloud. Broadcast Mode is for sending the sensor data from BLE to a connected cloud service. These settings can be changed by pressing the cog wheel in the top right of the main page.

The RSL10-SENSE-DB-GEVK firmware can also be edited and uploaded directly using the provided debugger. On Page 3 of the RSL10-SENSE-GEVK & RSL10-SENSE-DB-GEVK User Manual, you can find all of the information of how to upload your own ultra-low power firmware to the RSL10-SENSE-DB-GEVK.
